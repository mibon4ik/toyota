// It is difficult to definitively determine unused code without a comprehensive build and analysis process.

// Here are some potential areas to investigate for unused code:

// 1. Unused imports in components:
//    Carefully examine each import statement in your components to ensure that all imported variables, functions, and components are actually being used.

// 2. Dead code within functions:
//    Look for code blocks that are never executed or variables that are never used within functions.

// 3. Unused components:
//    Identify components that are not rendered anywhere in your application.

// 4. Redundant state variables:
//    Check if there are any state variables that are not being used or updated.

// 5. Unused CSS classes:
//    Use a CSS analyzer tool to identify CSS classes that are not being used in your application's stylesheets.
